Virtual Reality as a Tool for Empathy: As a pioneer in virtual reality, Lanier views VR as a potential tool for fostering empathy and understanding by allowing people to experience different perspectives and realities.

Economic Ideas: Lanier has proposed economic models that recognize the value of data provided by individuals, suggesting that people should be compensated for the data that companies collect from them.
